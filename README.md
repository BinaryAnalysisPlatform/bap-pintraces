# Overview

Pin tracer - a tracer based on [Pin: Intelâ€™s Dynamic Binary Instrumentation
Engine.](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pintool) It executes a binary
executable and saves trace data using [Protocol
Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) format. The contents of
the trace data is defined in
[bap-frames](https://github.com/BinaryAnalysisPlatform/bap-frames) project.

# Preparing to build

Note: building instructions assume that you're using Ubuntu, but it
may work on other systems, that uses apt-get.

Before build tracer, you need download and install
[pin](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pintool-downloads).

Here are installation example:

```bash
$ wget http://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/downloads/pin-2.14-71313-gcc.4.4.7-linux.tar.gz
```

Suppose we whant install pin to $(HOME)/opt directory then:

```bash
$ tar xvzf pin-2.14-71313-gcc.4.4.7-linux.tar.gz -C $HOME/opt
```

To let Pin's makefiles know where Pin is installed, set the PIN_ROOT environment
variable with a command like:

```bash
$ export PIN_ROOT=$HOME/opt/pin-2.14-71313-gcc.4.4.7-linux
```

To let bash know where pin executable is installed? add the PIN_ROOT to PATH
environment variable with a command like:
```bash
$ export PATH=$PATH:$PIN_ROOT
```

It is probably a good idea to put this command in
a startup script like .bashrc, so that you don't need to set the variable
every time you log in:

```bash
$ echo 'export PIN_ROOT=$HOME/opt/pin-2.14-71313-gcc.4.4.7-linux' >>$HOME/.bashrc
$ echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$PIN_ROOT' >>$HOME/.bashrc
```
